<h2>How to review my performance ?</h2>
<p>When you want to watch in detail if you have sung in tune, click on the "Freeze" button at the bottom left of the window. Everything stops: scrolling notes, the MIDI player and the capture of the microphone.</p>
<p>Use the horizontal elevator, which became active, to go back and see the height of your voice while you sang.</p>
<p>You can use the + and - buttons of the horinzontal and vertical zoom to see in more details. The vertical lift lets you display refocus on the sung notes.</p>
<p>When you have completed your review, you can clear the screen by pressing the button "Delete" immediately adjacent to "Freeze". This will allow you to more easily review the next performance.</p>
<p>To return to normal mode, click again on the "Freeze" button.
