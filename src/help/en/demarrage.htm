<h2>4 - Sing</h2>
<p>The melody is played in your speakers or headphones at the same time that the notes are displayed on the screen. If you can not hear what is played, it is necessary to change MIDI device settings and change the parameters settings.</p>
<p>What you sing appears as a red line, the notes of the melody in the form of green rectangles. Singing in tune means that the red line is almost always in the green squares.</p>
<p>If there are, the song lyrics also appear to help you.</p>
<p>The notes of the melody are displayed in grey before being played. They are played and their rectangles become green when they arrive on the vertical line.</p>
<p>You can change the pitch of what is played by using transposition buttons. To change the display position of the melody by full octaves, use the offset buttons.</p>
